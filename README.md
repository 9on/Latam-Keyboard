A Mac Keyboard Layout for latin american keyboards

![Belatrix Latin American layout](http://i.imgur.com/LdNrfqt.png)

If you prefer to use your latin american keyboard distribution with your macOS, then just copy `.keylayout` and `.icns` file into `~/Library/Keyboard\ /Layouts/` folder on your mac.

You'll probably need to log out or restart and then you may choose the Latin American layout under **System Preferences... > Keyboard > Input Sources**

You can type the following lines into your terminal


```
git clone https://github.com/belatrix/Latam-Keyboard.git && cd Latam-Keyboard && sudo cp BxLatam.* ~/Libray/Keyboard\ /Layouts/

```
